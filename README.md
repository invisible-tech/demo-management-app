1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd demo-management-app
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file using the `.env.local.example` as a template:
   ```
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-upstash-url
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-token
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your-slack-webhook-url  # Optional
   ```

   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Slack Integration Setup

The app can send notifications to a Slack channel when admins request edits on demos. To set this up:

### 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App" â†’ "From scratch"
3. Name your app (e.g., "Demo Management Bot") and select your workspace

### 2. Enable Incoming Webhooks

1. In your app settings, go to "Incoming Webhooks"
2. Toggle "Activate Incoming Webhooks" to On
3. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
4. Select the channel where you want notifications (e.g., #demo-requests)
5. Copy the webhook URL

### 3. Configure Environment Variable

Add the webhook URL to your `.env.local` file:
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

### 4. Notification Features

When an admin requests edits on a demo, the Slack channel will receive a formatted message containing:
- Demo title and type
- Assigned team member
- Admin notes with requested changes
- Demo URL (if available)
- Timestamp

**Note**: Slack integration is optional. The app will work normally without it, but notifications won't be sent.
